# MineAlert
🧠🚁 AI and IoT-Integrated Autonomous Mine Detection
AI-powered drone for autonomous landmine detection using multi-sensor fusion and real-time monitoring. Integrated with Twilio for instant SMS alerts, enhancing safety and efficiency.

🔍 Overview
This project presents an autonomous AI-based drone system designed to detect landmines with high accuracy and minimal human intervention. Leveraging advanced machine learning models (YOLOv8, Faster R-CNN) and multi-sensor fusion, the drone navigates and scans areas autonomously. Upon detecting a potential landmine, the system instantly sends SMS alerts via Twilio, ensuring quick response and increased safety in mine-affected zones.
